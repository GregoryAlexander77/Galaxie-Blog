1.10.2. Your Indemnification Obligation.
       1.10.2.1. Indemnification for Third Party-Claims.

The Indemnified Party must provide the Indemnifying Party with prompt written notice of a Claim; however, the Indemnified Party's failure to provide or delay in providing such notice will not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations under this section except to the extent the Indemnifying Party is prejudiced by the Indemnified Party's failure or delay. The Indemnified Party will give the Indemnifying Party full control of the defense and settlement of the Claim as long as such settlement does not include a financial obligation on or admission of liability by the Indemnified Party. If the Indemnified Party does not do so, then the Indemnified Party waives the Indemnifying Party's indemnification obligations under section 1.10.1 or 1.10.2, as applicable. The Indemnified Party will reasonably cooperate in the defense of the Claim and may appear, at its own expense, through counsel reasonably acceptable to the Indemnifying Party.

3.3.	Required Quantity of Licensed Developers.  Licensed Developers must correspond to the maximum number of seats you have purchased for the Product Package from us hereunder. This means that, at any given time, the number of Licensed Developers cannot exceed the number of seats that you have purchased from us and for which you have paid us all the applicable license fees pursuant to this EULA. The Product Package is in "use" on a computer when it is loaded into temporary memory (i.e. RAM) or installed into permanent memory (e.g. hard disk or other storage device).

3.4.3.	Updates - Trial License.  At our sole discretion, you may receive certain Updates for the Product Package version you are evaluating.

You will lose the right to receive support and Updates at the end of your Maintenance Period, unless you renew your access to updates and support for additional Maintenance Period(s) with us at additional cost. Your level of support (Lite, Priority or Ultimate) is determined at the time of initial license purchase. You may upgrade your level of support for individually purchased Products at any time during an active Maintenance Period provided we continue to make such levels of support generally available. Any support level upgrades (if purchased) and all access to support and Updates thereunder will be bound to the term of the then active Maintenance Period (i.e. the renewal/expiration date of your Maintenance Period will not change as a result of the support level upgrade). You generally may not downgrade your level of support and there is no automated mechanism available to you by which to downgrade. The level of support for all Products obtained as part of a DevTools Collection is determined according to the level of support specified for such DevTools Collection here: http://www.telerik.com/purchase/support-plans/devtools and may not be upgraded or downgraded. The following additional terms apply to support hereunder:
	(a) We may apply a Fair Usage Policy that allows us to limit or terminate your access to any or all of the support services if your use of the support services is determined by us, in our sole and reasonable discretion, to be excessive.

3.5.2.	Updates.  During the Maintenance Period, you will be eligible to receive all major Updates and minor Updates for the version of the Product Package that you license hereunder.

If you do not agree to such additional or conflicting terms and conditions, do not download or install the Update. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 2.A.2., with respect to: the UI Products, Kendo Products, Progress Telerik Reporting, Progress Telerik Report Designer, Progress Telerik Report Server, and Progress Telerik JustMock, you are not required to delete a Replaced Product ninety (90) days from delivery of the Update. You may continue to operate the Replaced Product for the duration of the term of the license governing use of the Replaced Product that was granted to you by us (or our predecessor in interest) upon initial delivery of the Replaced Product. For the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing does not expand the scope or quantity of licenses granted to you pursuant to any Order. Replaced Products may only be used by your Licensed Developer(s) (and in the case of Progress Telerik Report Server and Progress Telerik Report Designer, your CAL User(s)) who is/are licensed to use the updated Product Package hereunder. A Progress Telerik Report Server Replaced Product may not be used on any Domains that are different from or additional to the Domains on which you are licensed to use the Progress Telerik Report Server updated Product Package. Use of any Replaced Product is at your sole discretion and risk. Replaced Products are as-is and without warranty of any kind. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Progress: (a) hereby disclaims all warranties expressed hereunder or otherwise expressed or implied; (b) shall assume no indemnification obligations; and, (c) shall have no liability for damages of any kind, related to and/or resulting from the Replaced Products and/or the use thereof.

By enrolling in the Maintenance and Support Auto Renewal Program, you understand and agree that your access to Updates and support will automatically renew for subsequent one-year Maintenance Periods for the entire time that you remain actively enrolled in the Maintenance and Support Auto Renewal Program.
	(b)  As a condition of your initial and continued enrolment in the Maintenance and Support Auto Renewal Program, you agree to keep your credit card, billing, and contact information up-to-date at all times via Your Account. You may change your auto renewal preference at any time within Your Account or by contacting us directly. We may switch your auto renewal preference to "off" at any time we determine or suspect that your credit card, billing, and/or contact information is out of date, inaccurate, or fraudulent. We may disable or discontinue the Maintenance and Support Auto Renewal Program at any time for any reason without providing advance notice to you.
	(c)  Once you have enrolled in the Maintenance and Support Auto Renewal Program, unless you set the auto renewal preference to "off" in your account prior to the end of your existing Maintenance Period, your access to Updates and support will automatically renew, and you authorize us (without notice) to collect the then-applicable fee and any taxes for the renewal Maintenance Period, using the credit card or billing credentials that you provided with respect to your initial purchase and/or your enrollment in the Maintenance and Support Auto Renewal Program. All payments are non-refundable, even if you or your Licensed Developers stop using the Product and/or stop using or accessing support and Updates. The fees and features applicable to support and Updates may change over time. Your access will be renewed at an annual fee of 50% of the retail cost of a new Product license (at the time of renewal), and at the level we, in our sole discretion, identify as being closest to that which was provided during your previous Maintenance Period.
3.6.	Source Code.  Progress may make the source code for certain Product Packages available to you hereunder. Any Product Package source code that is provided to you by us hereunder, is provided so that your Licensed Developers can create modifications under the terms of this EULA and subject to the following conditions:

Except as otherwise expressly provided in this EULA, under no circumstances may any portion of the Product Package's source code or any modified version of the source code be distributed, disclosed or otherwise made available to any third party.
	(d)  We DO NOT provide technical support for any source code that has been modified by any party other than us.
	(e)  The Product Package's source code is provided "as is", without warranty of any kind. Refunds are not available for any licenses that include a right to receive source code.
3.7.	No Trademark License.  You may not use our product names, logos or trademarks to market Your Integrated Product.
3.8.	Destruction Requirement upon Termination.	Upon termination of this EULA, all licenses granted to you hereunder will terminate automatically and the terms of section 1.15.2 (Effect of Termination) will apply. Additionally, you must destroy: (i) all copies of the Product Package not integrated into a live, functioning instance(s) of Your Integrated Product(s) already installed, implemented and deployed for your Permitted End Users, and (ii) any product and company logos provided by us in connection with this EULA.
3.9.	Product Discontinuance.

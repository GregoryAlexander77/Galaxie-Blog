				  This was added because CF's built in security system has no way to determine if a user is logged on.
				  In the past, I used getAuthUser(), it would return the username if you were logged in, but
				  it also returns a value if you were authenticated at a web server level. (cgi.remote_user)
				  Therefore, the only say way to check for a user logon is with a flag.

			While we use roles above based on CF's built in stuff, I plan on moving away from that, and the role here
			is more a high level role. We need to add a blog user's specific roles to the session scope.

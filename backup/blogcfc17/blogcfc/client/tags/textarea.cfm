	History      : Use id (rkc 9/15/2006)
	Purpose		 : Makes it easier to add a Rich Text Editor, for you wimpy folks who can't write html by hand.
	             : I tell ya - in my day, we wrote our HTML by hand and we liked it gosh darnit. We didn't even
	             : have monitors. We had to write our HTML with punchcards. And our punchcards were made of tissue
	             : paper and would break if you didn't write it exactly right.

UPGRADE NOTES:
Find your current version in the notes below, and read 'upwards' to determine what files you have to copy. 
Note - if your blog is running RIGHT now, you will want to ensure your first hit on your blog (after you copied files and made any other changes) refreshes the blog cache.
This is done by adding ?reinit=1 to the URL.

The following changes were made by Stephen Moretti:
 * updated jquery.selectbox.js
 * added pageadmin user role and retricted access to page related functions in the admin menu
 * made print use the entry alias for the file name instead of just "print"
 * added a random number to the end of the ajax call in the admin entry form to help prevent IE caching of data
 * added cfcontent to proxy.cfm to make sure that json is returned with the correct mime type to keep IE happier
 * added a couple of admin css hacks to make the login form and select boxes on the entry form display correctly in IE7.

Added a robots.txt file to block search engines from the mobile version. Credit goes to James Moberg

Fix by Dan Switzer to xmlrpc/xmlrpc.cfm - his notes:

The patch I just checked in to SVN fixes a problem where new media objects can incorrectly overwrite an existing entry. Here's what happens.
When a user would copy/paste an image from the Windows clipboard into Windows Live Writer, WLW ends up giving the image a generic name like "image.gif".
Now this isn't a problem in WLW as it stores the image for each blog entry in a separate space on disk.
However, when you'd go to publish the code, the old xmlrpc.cfm would parse the file name information for the filename as it is on the local file system. So, everytime a "image.gif" file was found, it would overwrite the old one.
To fix this, I MD5 hash the entire "name" value passed from the WLW--which includes pathing information. This should create a unique name that would correctly update existing images from the same blog entry.
Hopefully this makes sense.

-Dan

Last Updated: TBD (BlogCFC 5.9.8.001)

This update overhauls the user security mechanism in blogCFC.  Going forward, passwords in the tblusers table are no longer stored as plain text.  Instead,
a practice known as salting and hashing has been added to help protect user accounts against compromise, especially from brute force attacks.  There's been a lot
written on the subject of salting/hashing passwords, some good and some misinformed.  For a good general introduction, please see: 
https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Salt_%28cryptography%29

In order to provide for some flexibility in the system, you have options regarding what encryption/hash algorithms are used to generate both the salt and the password hash.
Unless you have a reason to do otherwise, the default values should suffice in most installations:

saltAlgorithm=AES (the algorithm used to generate the salt)
saltKeySize=256 (key size used to generate the salt)
hashAlgorithm=SHA-512 (algorithm used to generate the salt)

If you are installing a clean copy of blogCFC 5.9.8.001 and using the installer, you don't need to do anything to the database as the installer contains the latest updates 
to automatically create the updated tables as long as you are using MS SQL Server or MySQL for the database.  If you are using MS Access, you don't need to run
the installer. The MDB file included with BlogCFC is already updated with the security enhancements and uses the default values for the aforementioned crypto properties. If 
you are running Oracle, the install scripts have been updated but you have to run them manually. The installer will not perform a fresh install for Oracle. To do this, 
you'll need to run /install/oracle.sql.

If you are updating an existing BlogCFC install, there's an updater included in /install/updater5.9.8.001. You'll need to move this directory into your web root in order
to run the updater.  The updater makes use of the cfdbinfo tag, and because of this it's only supported in ColdFusion 8+.  Please note that the updater will work with 
MS SQL Server, MySQL, Oracle and MS Access databases. You must run this updater or your BlogCFC installation will not work after updating the rest of the files in this 
release.  WARNING! Before you run the updater, it is strongly recommended that you make a backup of your tblusers table.  Running this updater will alter your existing 
users table and will result in hashing all of the passwords for all of the blogs in the database. Because a hash is a one-way operation, it is not possible to decrypt or 
reverse the changes made to your database.  If you blow up your users table and don't have a backup it's your fault, not ours.  The updater will also automatically append 
the crypto properties to you blogcfc.ini.cfm file for all supported database platforms.

Once the update has completed, you will no longer be able to view passwords in the database.  Also note that if you've written any custom password recovery code, you'll
most likely have to update that as well as it's no longer possible to send users their passwords.  If you require this type of self-service functionality, you'll need to
code a solution that implements a password reset. 

Note that you will not be able to edit the crypto settings from the Admin. This is intentional as one you've hashed your database, you can't simply rehash it with a different
algorithm.

Updated Files:
/install/mysql.sql - updated script to add salt field to tblusers and changed length of password to 256. Also added hashed password for the admin using the default crypto values.
/install/mssql.sql - updated script to add salt field to tblusers and changed length of password to 256. Also added hashed password for the admin using the default crypto values.
/install/oracle.sql - updated script to add salt field to tblusers and changed length of password to 256. Also added hashed password for the admin using the default crypto values.
/install/readme.txt -updated with the latest release notes.

/client/org/camden/blog/blog.cfc - Added instance variables for crypto properties, modified addUser() to add salt and hash password, modified authenticate() to use a hashed password,
								   removed "password" from the SQL statement in getUsers() because it's not actually used anywhere, updated saveUser()
								   to use salt and hashed passwords, added new generateSalt() method.

=======================================================================================================================================================================================
Last Updated: January 20, 2011 (BlogCFC 5.9.8)

5.9.8 is a rather drastic update to BlogCFC. First, a new theme is being used. This theme is a radical departure from the previous skin. 
Next - trackbacks as a feature has been removed. For years now TBs were nothing but spam bait and used by only a very few of our users
so it was decided to simply remove them. 

You will also notice that the org folder now resides within the main client folder. Since most users had a simple setup like that it was decided
to simply put the folder where most folks would end up using it. 

The mobile folder has a few updates as well. You can simply copy that entire folder over.

Existing users will - most likely - want to set up a test server with the new code base pointing to their database and see how the new skin works with their data.

Note - looks like I screwed the pooch on readme.old2.txt. If folks really need something from the old history, I can grab it
from SVN, but for now, I assume it isn't critical.

/org/camden/blog/blog.cfc - just the version #

/client/Application.cfm - another bug fix

Last Updated: April 3, 2010 (BlogCFC 5.9.5.006)

/org/camden/blog/blog.cfc - Just the version #.

I trimmed this file quite a bit and put older comments in readme.old2.txt.

Last Updated: March 3, 2010 (BlogCFC 5.9.5.005) | Brian Kotek, Raymond Camden
/client/tags/scopecache.cfm - Update scope cache to latest version
/client/index.cfm - removed use of {} which broke cf6 compat
/client/admin/comments.cfm - Support for Approving comments - I forget who wrote this. Sorry!
/org/camden/blog/blog.cfc -> From mailEntry, tell RenderEntry not to add Ps. Also, we won't run coldfish on code blocks for mail entries. 
/org/sweetweets/* -> Updated to 2.0
/client/admin/latestversioncheck.cfm - try/catch the http hit

/client/Application.cfm - support for Installer

NOTES TO EXISTING USERS:
This version includes Installer support. Since your blog is already running, you don't need this folder. You can skip copying it. However, you MUST set up this property in your blog.ini.cfm:
installed=yes
That flags BlogCFC to say you already have run the installer.

Last Updated: December 20, 2009 (BlogCFC 5.9.5.003) | Raymond Camden 
At a high level, the changes in this version are for XHTML tuning (see below), and to support pages that don't use layout. That change requires a database change for existing users. Modify your tblBlogPages
table to add a "showlayout" column. This is a boolean type (used tinyint for mysql). For existing pages, don't worry. If the value for them is null, it is assumed to be a true value.

Note - this version includes many XHTML tuning fixes. Thanks for these go to Andreas Schuldhaus.

Last Updated: July 15, 2009 (BlogCFC 5.9.4 (Test)) | Raymond Camden 

WARNING - PLEASE READ THIS CAREFULLY. THIS RELEASE ADDS NEW TABLES AND NEW SETTINGS AND IF YOU DO NOT FOLLOW THESE DIRECTIONS, YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO LOGON TO YOUR BLOG.
YOU HAVE BEEN WARNING. -ZOD

First off, the new features of this release are NOT documented in the doc/pdf yet. They will be. Check the blog entry for full details. This file will mainly describe what you have to do to get
the new build up and running. Also be sure to copy all the files listed below. Ok, so let's begin.

First, create the tblblogroles table. You will find this in the install scripts for MySQL and SQL Server. Note that you also need to run the seed statements as well.

Second, the tblusers table now has a blog column. THIS IS CRITICAL. You must add the blog column, and for each user, you must enter their blog. This associates
the user with a blog. In the past, we used the "users" property in blog.ini.cfm to say which users were matched to a blog. That property is now gone (ignored). So
if you currently have one user in N blogs, you need to create N rows in the database, one for each blog he used to belong to.

Third, run the create script for tbluserroles. This table sets roles for users. At minimum, you want to set up your Admin user to have the Admin role. You can take this line:

INSERT INTO `blogcfc`.`tbluserroles` VALUES  ('admin','7F25A20B-EE6D-612D-24A7C0CEE6483EC2','Default');

and modify the first value (admin) to match your username. Once you've done that, you have a 'real' admin user with a 'admin' role who can set up your other users.

I'm going to repeat the above to ensure it makes sense. You have one table that lists all roles - you must create and seed it. Your users table now has a blog column. And lastly, tbluserroles creates a
relationship between the two.

Ok - so in theory, thats it. Please the blog entry for a description of how these changes are used.

Oracle/Access NOT updated. Looking for volunteers. On July 20, I checked in an Access update by Andy Florino. May be ok now.



Misc Changes:
Removed old coloredcode function

Last Updated: May 14, 2009 (BlogCFC 5.9.3.005) | Raymond Camden 

Note - the main fix in this build is to SweetTweets. ST can be VERY slow on the first hit. I've switched to using jQuery to dynamically load the STs in. So
when you first hit the page, you will see a loading msg in that area.

/admin/entry.cfm - Fix to image url issue for uploaded images.

/tags/layout.cfm - support loading jQuery library
/loadtweetbacks.cfm - New file
/index.cfm - support changes to tweetbacks

/org/camden/blog/blog.cfc
 * Added check to renderEntry() function to look for existing <p> tags and if they exist, it does not use the xParagraphFormatting (although you can override this behavior by setting the ignoreParagraphFormat to false.) Adding this check helps produce valid XHTML when you're blog is already correctly entered in as XHTML.

/client/include/pods/calendar.cfm - Oracle fix.
/client/stats.cfm - Oracle fix
/org/camdne/blog/blog.cfc - version #
/install/BLogCFC.pdf and doc - Oracle notes.

All of the above thanks to Nick Hill.

/client/xmlrpc/xmlrpc.cfm
 * Added some code to clean up <more /> tags entered when use the url.parseMarkup variable. The new code removes <p> elements wrapped around a <p>&lt;more/&gt;</p> string, which helps to produce valid XHTML.

/client/xmlrpc/xmlrpc.cfm - some small fixes, but NOTE, I officially consider XMLRPC support to be a bit fubared.
/org/camden/blog/blog.cfc - Removed author name from the RSS. Why? It was causing an issue with validation. The author value for RSS2 must be an email address, and I was
using a username. This kinda sucks for multiuser blogs. For now, what I recommend is this:

a) If you store usernames, consider a small mod to the RSS method to say, 'if username=X,do email address Y.'
Yes, it's a hack, but it would get proper attribution back in the RSS feed.

b) I thought I had a b, but I don't. So this b is superflorous.

/org/sweettweets/SweetTweets.cfc - Fix to a case sensitivity issue. I also reported the issue to the official SweetTweets project.

 * Added trim() statement to code being passed to the codeRenderer.formatString() render--this prevents the formatter from adding <br /> before and after the code

/org/delmore/coldfish.cfc

<b>Oracle 10g Notes</b>:
</p>

<p>Note - for Oracle, only version 10g is supported.</p>

<p><i>The following notes come from Nick Hill. Thanks Nick!</i></p>

<p>When you install BlogCFC onto a server utilizing Oracle as
your datasource, you will need to be aware of some factors that may inhibit the 
installation. The installation scripts are broken into 2 parts. The first is the table creation, grants and constraints. The second part
is utilizing Oracle Synonyms to allow for general relation of tables names to
limit the difference in the application code.</p>

<p>In some production scenarios access to Public Synonyms is
blocked by the DBA. Oracle may be configured as a single database with multiple
schemas. If public synonyms were allowed, any schema would be able to access
the BlogCFC tables. If the previous scenario does not apply to your Oracle
installation you may not have any issues with the Oracle scripts as they are
currently written. If however your installation does match the above described
scenario please be aware of the following changes to the scripts.</p>

<p><b>Oracle.sql</b></p>

<p>The first thing to be aware of is that when you are running
this script you will want to be logged in as the SCHEMA OWNER for the Oracle
schema and NOT the CF Datasource user that you are about to configure. It is a
good practice to use a separate Oracle User (not the schema owner) for
CFAdministrator to access your Schema. Specific to the script you will want to
make changes to the lines that follow <code>insert into TBLUSERS</code></p>

<p>You will first want to change <code>yourschema</code> to not be a
schema name, but actually the separate Oracle User that you will assign to the datasource
in CF Administrator. Ex. (make sure you do not use these example names)</p>

<p>Oracle Schema: MyBlog<br/>
Oracle Schema Owner: BlogAdmin<br/>
CFAdministrator User: CFBlogAdmin
</p>

<p>(This is the name you enter in CFAdministrator in the &quot;Data &amp; Services &gt; Datasources &gt; Oracle&quot; Screen next 
to the &quot;User name&quot; label).</p>

<p>Before you run Oracle.sql replace <code>yourschema</code> with the
CFAdministrator User (CFBlogAdmin).</p>

<p>Logged in as the schema owner (BlogAdmin) you will run
Oracle.sql. This will grant the necessary priviledges to CFAdmin.</p>

<p><b>Oracle_synonyms.sql</b></p>

<p>This is where Oracle is different from the other DB's. You
will now want to LOGOUT as the Schema Owner (BlogAdmin) and log in as the
CFAdmin User (CFBlogAdmin). Before you run oracle_synonyms.sql you will need to
make some changes to the code. You will need to preface each tablename with the
Oracle Schema that is being used. Ex.</p>

<p>CREATE SYNONYM TBLUSERS FOR MyBlog.TBLUSERS;</p>

<p>With all of the lines changed, now you will want to run this
script as the CFAdmin user (CFBlogAdmin). What you have done is created a
PRIVATE synonym for these tables that ONLY CFAdmin will be able to use which
will ensure that you do not have to preface every table name in the Client code
with additional scoping of the Oracle Schema.</p>
